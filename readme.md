### All Cards
Small program that will loop through all the cards on [magicthegathering.io](https://docs.magicthegathering.io/) and puts them in one `.json` file for you convenience.

## Usuage
Install the dependencies first: `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`, after that run the script: `python3 main.py`.

## Info
There are around 450 pages, which is 45000 cards in total, so give it some time.
